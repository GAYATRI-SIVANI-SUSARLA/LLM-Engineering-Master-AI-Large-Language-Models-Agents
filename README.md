### Goal
I am very much fascinated with developing Large Language Models, so I enrolled in LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents course offered by [Edward Donner](https://edwarddonner.com/). Here I am, excited to share my interesting projects I learned through the 8-week course to become an LLM Engineer.
